== Description ==

Thinking of making some money with your website? Try AdRotate. With AdRotate you can easily place advertising banners pretty much anywhere on your site while managing almost everything from the easy to use dashboard. No fussing with your themes code if you don't want to.
Create your own adverts with basic HTML/Javascript code or use adverts from your favorite Ad Server such as DFP, AdSense, Chitika, Doubleclick, JuiceAds and many similar services.

Manage your advertising campaigns with ease, right in your dashboard. Check up on how many impressions adverts have. Monitor ad groups and see which are most effective. Make the most of advertising with the many features AdRotate has to offer. AdRotate looks and feels similar to the WordPress dashboard you already know, so you're already familiar with AdRotate before you've even started. Familiarize yourself with the many useful features and you'll be up and running very quickly.
